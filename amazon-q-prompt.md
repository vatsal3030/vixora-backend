I have a complete backend for a YouTube-like application.

Please analyze the following files:
- project-context.md
- api-documentation.md
- frontend-requirements.md
- postman-collection.json

I want you to generate a complete frontend using:

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Axios
- React Router v6
- Context API

The frontend should:
- Be production-ready
- Follow clean architecture
- Have reusable components
- Fully integrate with backend APIs
- Support authentication, video upload, comments, likes, subscriptions
- Be responsive and modern (YouTube-style UI)

Please generate:
- Project structure
- All pages
- API service layer
- Context providers
- Reusable components
- Routing setup

Assume backend is stable and APIs work correctly.
